"""Inbound ports the application service expects.

The MCP server's inbound surface is the tool dispatch path: a tool
handler reads the caller's identity from the bearer token, asks the
:class:`Authorizer` whether the call may proceed, and only then invokes
the application service. The port lives here so the adapter side can
provide either a pass-through (local dev) or a policy-service-backed
implementation without the application layer having to know which is
wired.
