"""Scenario loader — parses YAML files under ``tests/evals/scenarios/``.

A scenario file is a small YAML document describing one prompt-to-tools
walkthrough. The format is deliberately flat so a contributor adding a
scenario does not need to read this module to follow the existing ones.

Example::

    name: get_current_standings
    description: User asks for the current Women's Super League standings
    tool_sequence:
      - tool: get_standings
        args: {}
    expected_contains:
      - "Standings"
      - "GP"

The loader resolves paths relative to ``tests/evals/scenarios/`` so the
test discovery does not depend on the caller's CWD.

    Field semantics:

    * ``name`` — file-system-safe identifier; used as the report key.
    * ``description`` — human-readable prompt (an LLM judge would read
      this to score the response in a future phase).
    * ``tool_sequence`` — the tools the scenario invokes, in order.
    * ``expected_contains`` — strings that must appear in the joined
      tool outputs for the scenario to pass. Treated as a substring
      check — case-insensitive on Windows-style line endings would be
      brittle, so the match is exact.
    * ``live`` — when True the scenario opts in to live-instance replay
      via ``MCP_EVAL_REMOTE_URL``. Scenarios whose ``expected_contains``
      depend on stub-specific values must stay False so the in-process
      run and the live run agree on pass/fail semantics.
    * ``expected_judge`` — semantic criteria graded by the LLM-as-judge
      backend (:mod:`tests.evals.judge`). Each criterion is sent to
      Claude separately with the joined tool output; the scenario
      passes the judge step when every criterion is graded PASS.
      Empty by default — substring assertions cover the deterministic
      case; the judge is for outputs whose phrasing varies (live data,
      formatter refactors) but whose meaning should be preserved.
