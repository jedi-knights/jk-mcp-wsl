"""Tests for the _safe_call_authorized dispatcher.

The dispatcher is the bridge between every tool handler and the
application service: authorize → execute → format. The tests verify
that a denial short-circuits before the coroutine is awaited (so the
upstream call never happens) and that an allow proceeds to the
normal _safe_call path.
