"""Tests for the LLM-as-judge verdict parser.

The Claude round trip itself is integration territory (and costs
money); these tests pin the response-parsing behaviour so a wire
change in the prompt template surfaces immediately. The parser is
the only piece of the judge with real branching — the rest is the
anthropic SDK call.
